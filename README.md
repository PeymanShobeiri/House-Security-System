# House Security System
This is a startup project created by a team of 3 to develop a security system that sends alerts to pre-defined homeowners in case of any unauthorized trespassing.
## Features
The House Security System has the following features:
* Motion detection: The system uses a motion sensor to detect any movement within the premises of the house.
* Alert system: In case of any unauthorized trespassing, the system sends a short message and calls the pre-defined homeowners to alert them.
* Remote access: The system can be accessed remotely through a SMS, which allows to receive alerts.

## Hardware Requirements
* STM-32: The system runs on STM-32.
* SIM card sim800: The system uses a SIM card sim800 for sending text messages and making phone calls.
* Motion detector: The system uses a motion detector to detect motion.
* Hal library: The system uses Hal library for hardware abstraction.

## Usage
Once the House Security System is installed, you can use it as follows:
1. Activate the system by turning on the motion detector.
2. Receive alerts in case of any unauthorized trespassing.
